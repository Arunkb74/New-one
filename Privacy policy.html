                            appear in our mobile application and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or demographic information. 
                            When you click on an offer wall, you will leave our mobile application. A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with 
                            the offer wall provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account.</li>

                <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. 
                    Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Policy.</p>

                <p class="pt-5">6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?  </p>

                <p>In Short:  If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>

                <p>Our Services or Apps offer you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook logins). 
                    Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile 
                    Information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, e-mail address, 
                    friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public.</p>
                
                <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy policy or that are otherwise made 
                    clear to you on the Services or Apps. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal 
                    information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy policy to understand how they 
                    collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

                <p class="pt-5">7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

                <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>

                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless 
                    a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). When we have no 
                    ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not 
                    possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your 
                    personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                <p class="pt-5">8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

                <p>In Short:  We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

                <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal 
                    information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although 
                    we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services or Apps 
                    is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>

                <p class="pt-5">9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>

                <p>In Short:  We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

                <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services or Apps, you represent 
                    that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the 
                    Services or Apps. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate 
                    the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have 
                    collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="#" class="text-font">info@itsdelight.com</a></p>

                <p class="pt-5">10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

                <p>In Short:  In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. 
                    You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>

                <p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include 
                    the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to 
                    restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may 
                    also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the <a href="#" class="text-font">contact details</a> 
                    provided below at the end of this document. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection 
                    laws.</p>

                <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please 
                    note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal.</p>

                <p>If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have 
                    the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details 
                    here: <a href="#" class="font-text">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/dataprotection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a></p>

                <p>Account Information</p>

                <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>

                <p class="pl-4">■ Log into your account settings and update your user account.</p>

                <p class="pl-5">■ Contact us using the contact information provided.</p>

                <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, 
                    some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our 
                    Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.</p>

                <p>Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your 
                    browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain 
                    features or services of our Services or Apps.</p>

                <p>Opting out of email marketing: You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails 
                    that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list – however, we 
                    will still need to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account. To otherwise 
                    opt-out, you may:</p>

                <p class="pl-2">■ Contact us using the contact information provided.</p>

                <p class="pt-5">11. DATA BREACH</p>

                <p>A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You will be 
                    notified about data breaches when DELIGHT believes you are likely to be at risk of serious harm. For example, a data breach may be 
                    likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that DELIGHT become aware of a 
                    security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information DELIGHT will 
                    promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware 
                    of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>

                <p class="pt-5">12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you 
                    can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. 
                    No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently 
                    respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. 
                    If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised 
                    version of this privacy policy.</p>

                <p class="pt-5">13. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</p>

                <p>In Short:  Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>

                <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated 
                    version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either 
                    by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy 
                    policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>

                <p class="pt-5">14. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS POLICY? </p>

                <p>If you have questions or comments about this policy, you may email us at <a href="#" class="text-font">info@itsdelight.com</a></p>

                <p>HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</p>

                <p class="pb-5">Based on the laws of some countries, you may have the right to request access to the personal information we collect from you, 
                    change that information, or delete it in some circumstances. To request to review, update, or delete your personal information,
