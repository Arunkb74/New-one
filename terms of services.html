                    notice to you. You agree that we have no liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by your inability to access 
                    or use the Site or the Marketplace Offerings during any downtime or discontinuance of the Site or the Marketplace Offerings. Nothing in 
                    these Terms of Service will be construed to obligate us to maintain and support the Site or the Marketplace Offerings or to supply any 
                    corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith.</p>

                <p>GOVERNING LAW</p>

                <p>These Terms of Service and your use of the Site and the Marketplace Offerings are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
                    the State of Karnataka, India applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of Karnataka, India, without 
                    regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

                <p>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>

                <p>Informal Negotiations</p>

                <p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Service (each a "Dispute" and collectively, 
                    the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first 
                    attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before 
                    initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>

                <p>Binding Arbitration</p>

                <p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and 
                    exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT. The 
                    arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the applicable laws on India. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator 
                    compensation shall be governed by the arbitration laws of India and the governing rules. If such costs are determined to by the arbitrator 
                    to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of 
                    documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless 
                    requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. 
                    Except where otherwise required by the applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Karnataka India. Except as otherwise provided 
                    herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or 
                    enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>

                <p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal 
                    courts located in Karnataka, India, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum 
                    non convenience with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and central court. Application of the United Nations Convention on 
                    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms 
                    of Service.</p>

                <p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of 
                    action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling 
                    within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent 
                    jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that 
                    court.</p>

                <p>Restrictions</p>

                <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) 
                    no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a 
                    class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a 
                    purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>

                <p>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</p>

                <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) 
                    any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any 
                    Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for 
                    injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute 
                    falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of 
                    competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of 
                    that court.</p>
